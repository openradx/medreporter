# Measurements

To calculate nodule mean diameter, measure both the long and short axis to one decimal point in mm, and report mean nodule diameter to one decimal point. The long and short axis measurements may be in any plane to reflect the true size of the nodule. Volumes, if obtained, should be reported to the nearest whole number in mmÂ³.
