- Images should be acquired in full inspiration and reconstructed in thin slice.
- Nodules should be measured on axial plane in lung window. Sagittal or coronal plane may be used if the longest diameters lie in those planes.
- When multiple nodules are present, only the largest or morphologically most suspicious need to be measured and have their location(s) reported.
- Typical perifissural nodules (triangular or oval in the axial plane, and flat or lentiform in the sagittal and coronal planes) not necessarily require follow-up even if measuring greater than 6 mm.
- Reporting:
  - Nodules smaller than 3 mm should not be measured and should be described as micronodules.
  - Nodules between 3 and 10 mm should be specified with the average of short and long axis.
  - Nodules bigger than 10 mm and masses should be described in long and short axis separately.
  - In part-solid nodules solid components over 3 mm should have the maximal diameter reported
