# Structure
toolDescriptionAdrenalWashout: >
  Characterization of unclear adrenal lesions to detect adenomas by using 
  computed tomography.
groupDensity: Density (HU)
inputLabelNonEnhanced: Non-enhanced phase
inputLabelPortalVenous: Portal venous phase
inputLabelDelayed: Delayed phase
hintRoiPlacement: >
  The ROI should cover approximately two-third of the lesion without including the
  periphery.
hintPreferAbsoluteWashout: >
  Whenever possible the absolute washout should be preferred.

# Report
textAbsoluteWashoutRequirements: >
  Absolute washout requires non enhanced, portal venous and delayed phase.
textRelativeWashoutRequirements: >
  Relative washout requires portal and delayed phase.

# Suggestion categories
missingValues: Missing specification of density values.
noSuggestionPossible: >
  With the values entered, no assessment of the indeterminate adrenal lesion is possible.
  Complementary imaging such as FDG-PET/CT or MRI with in-phase (IP) and
  out-of-phase (OOP) sequences should be considered.
suggestionDensityLowerZeroAdenoma: >
  An adrenal lesion with a density < 0 HU on nonenhanced CT is highly specific for
  lipid-rich adenoma (47% sensitive, 100% specific)
suggestionDensityLowerTenAdenoma: >
  An adrenal lesion with a density < 10 HU on nonenhanced CT is fairly specific for
  lipid-rich adenoma (71% sensitive, 98% specific)"
suggestionHighDensityMalignancy: >
  An adrenal lesion with a density > 43 HU on nonenhanced CT that is neither calcified
  not hemorrhagic is suspicious for malignancy regardless of washout characteristics.
  Further diagnostic like FDG-PET/CT should be considered instead of washout imaging."
suggestionHighEnhancementPheochromocytoma: >
  An adrenal lesion that enhances > 130 HU is concerning for hypervascular pheochromocytoma.
suggestionHighAbsoluteWashoutAdenoma: >
  An adrenal lesion with > 60% washout is highly suggestive of adrenal adenoma.
suggestionLowAbsoluteWashoutAdenoma: >
  An adrenal lesion with < 60% washout is not confirming an adrenal adenoma. An alternative
  diagnoses should be considered.
suggestionHighRelativeWashoutAdenoma: >
  An adrenal lesion with > 40% washout is highly suggestive of adrenal adenoma.
suggetionLowRelativeWashoutAdenoma: >
  An adrenal lesion with < 40% washout is not confirming adrenal adenoma. An alternative
  diagnoses should be considered.
