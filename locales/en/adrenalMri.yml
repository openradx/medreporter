  toolTitle: Adrenal gland MRI
  toolDescription: >
    Characterization of unclear adrenal lesions to detect adenomas by using 
    MRI.
  groupLabelAdrenal: Adrenal lesion
  inputLabelAdrenalInPhase: Signal In-Phase
  inputLabelAdrenalOppPhase: Signal Opposed-Phase
  groupLabelSpleen: Spleen
  inputLabelSpleenInPhase: Signal In-Phase
  inputLabelSpleenOppPhase: Signal Opposed-Phase
  hintLimitations: > 
    Cave: The informative value of the MRI signal intensity measurements is less than the 
    washout measurements in the CT for lesions with native ≥20 HU and clearly limited for lesions 
    with native ≥30 HU.
  hintTesla: >
    Cave: The limit value of the signal drop of 16.5% was determined at 1.5 Tesla. At 3 Tesla, 
    the limit may be lower.

  # Report
  textSignalDropoutRequirements: >
    The calculation of the signal drop requires the signal values ​​of the adrenal lesion in 
    in- and opposed-phase.
  textSignalDropoutWithValue: "Signal drop of the lesion between in-phase and opposed-phase: {{value}} %"
  textAdrenalToSpleenRatioRequirements: >
    The calculation of the lesion to spleen ratio requires the signal values ​​of the adrenal lesion 
    and the spleen in in- and opposed-phase.
  textAdrenalToSpleenRatioWithValue: "Ratio of signal drop of the lesion to spleen: {{value}}"

  # Suggestion categories
  missingValues: Missing values.  
  csiAdenoma: The signal drop is greater than 16.5%, the lesion is classified as a lipid-rich adenoma.
  csiUnclear: The signal drop is less than or equal to 16.5%, the lesion is classified as unclear.
  toSpleenAdenoma: >
    The ratio of the signal drop of the lesion to spleen is less than 0.71, the lesion is classified 
    as a lipid-rich adenoma.
  toSpleenUnclear: >
    The ratio of the lesion to spleen ratio is greater than or equal to 0.71, the lesion is classified 
    as unclear.
