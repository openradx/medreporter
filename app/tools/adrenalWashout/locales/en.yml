densityLowerZeroAdenoma: |
  An adrenal lesion with a density <0 HU on nonenhanced CT is highly specific for
  lipid-rich adenoma (47% sensitive, 100% specific)
densityLowerTenAdenoma: |
  An adrenal lesion with a density <10 HU on nonenhanced CT is fairly specific for
  lipid-rich adenoma (71% sensitive, 98% specific)"
highDensityMalignancy: |
  An adrenal lesion with a density >43 HU on nonenhanced CT that is neither calcified
  not hemorrhagic is suspicious for malignancy regardless of washout characteristics.
  Further diagnostic like FDG-PET/CT should be considered instead of washout imaging."
highEnhancementPheochromocytoma: |
  An indeterminate adrenal lesion that enhances more than 130 HU is concerning for
  hypervascular pheochromocytoma."
highAbsoluteWashoutAdenoma: |
  >60% washout is highly suggestive of adrenal adenoma.
lowAbsoluteWashoutAdenoma: |
  <60% washout is not confirming adrenal adenoma, alternative diagnoses should be considered.
highRelativeWashoutAdenoma: |
  >40% washout is highly suggestive of adrenal adenoma.
lowRelativeWashoutAdenoma: |
  <40% washout is not confirming adrenal adenoma, alternative diagnoses should be considered.
